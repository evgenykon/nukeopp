        <h3>What you should know ...</h3>
        <h4>now</h4>
        <p>There are some simple steps that should be done before something happens.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Check your home location for distance from <g-link to="/targets">potential war targets</g-link>. If its too close to you then you should try to find any opportunities to move 
            further away BEFORE everything happens.
          </li>
          <li>Prepare your <g-link to="/alarm-case">"Alarm case"</g-link>.</li>
          <li>Learn about <g-link to="/first-aid">First aid</g-link>.</li>
          <li>Print a <g-link to="/cheatsheet">Nuclear War Cheatsheet</g-link>. Discuss with family and friends about your actions during and after explosions.</li>
          <li>Think about people with disabilities.</li>
          <li>Think about your actions with your pets.</li>
          <li>Try to find out something about your closest shelters. Some information may appear in a few days or hours before attack. </li>
          <li>Learn about <g-link to="/scenarios">probable war scenarios</g-link>. May be it helps you determine what stage the world is at.</li>
          <li>Look at some other people stories about preparing. May be you want to ask them about something or share your story with us.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>if the war started</h4>
        <p>Each sentence in this chapter are based on some probability, but it doesn't have to happen.  
          But you probably won't be able to read this AFTER. So please print out <g-link to="/cheatsheet">cheatsheet</g-link> now. 
          And read just in case at least ones. In critical moment you have only your pure mind and some information that you were able to remember.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you are injured</li>
          <li>If you are close to potential targets</li>
          <li>If you are in one of the countries: USA, Russia, China</li>
          <li>If you are far from any shelters</li>
          <li>If you can hide inside shelter without any food or water</li>
          <li>If you did everything well and ended up in a shelter</li>
        </ol>
